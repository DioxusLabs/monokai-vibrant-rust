</p>

<p align="center">A very dark and vibrant Monokai based theme - forked and modified for Rust and Dioxus</p>

> This is a fork of [s3gf4ult/monokai-vibrant](https://github.com/s3gf4ult/monokai-vibrant) with some modifications to make it work with Dioxus and Rust. We modified some colors to be better for Rust code.

* üç≠ Vibrant colors for better readability
* üíª Italicized keywords compliments "Operator Mono" or similar fonts (optional)

## Disable Italics

If you are not using a font that does not support italics, you can add this to your `settings.json` to disable them.

```json
"editor.tokenColorCustomizations": {
  "textMateRules": [
    {
      "name": "Monokai Vibrant - No Italics",
      "scope": [
        "comment",
        "string.comment",
        "variable.language",
        "keyword",
        "storage",
        "variable.parameter"
      ],
      "settings": {
        "fontStyle": ""
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Extras

A long-term goal of this project is to provide color schemes for other popular applications in the `/extras` folder. A vim/nvim theme would be greatly appreciated if anyone is interested in contributing.
